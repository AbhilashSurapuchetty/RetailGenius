## 🧠 Objectives

- Analyze sales, inventory, and demand patterns.
- Forecast future product demand using machine learning.
- Understand the effect of promotions, discounts, weather, and seasonality.
- Assist in making data-driven restocking and pricing decisions.

## 📦 Dataset Features

The dataset contains ~73,000 rows with the following sample columns:

- `Date`
- `Store ID`
- `Product ID`
- `Category`
- `Region`
- `Inventory Level`
- `Units Sold`
- `Units Ordered`
- `Demand Forecast`
- `Price`
- `Discount`
- `Weather Condition`
- `Holiday/Promotion`

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature engineering (time features, lag features)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing trends and patterns
   - Correlation heatmaps

3. **Model Building**
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - XGBoost Regressor
   - LightGBM Regressor

4. **Model Evaluation**

- **Advanced Models**: Models like XGBoost and LightGBM outperformed basic linear models.
- **Key Features**:
  - `Units Sold`
  - `Price`
  - `Discount`
  - `Seasonality`
  - `Holiday`
